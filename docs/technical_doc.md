# Overview
This project uses Deep Learning techniques to detection the presence of whale calls using public onshore seismograph data, which is publicy available via [Canadian National Seismograph Network (CNSN)](https://earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/stndon/CNSN-RNSC/index-en.php). We focus on the call detections of the endangered species of Blue Whales and Fin Whales in the Lower St-Lawrence Seaway.

    Figure 1. An overview of the framework. The seismic data shown here is a sample of a blue whale call detected on station PMAQ and the timestamp of this call is '2021-10-02 07:13:33.02'. The waveform has been filtered with a  band pass filter [10, 32] HZ.</div>
